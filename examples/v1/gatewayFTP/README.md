# Custom FTP gateway

This is an example to show how to use a gateway to manage the content of a remote folder stored on a FTP server.

The folder `ts` and the folder `js` are the same thing. The `js` folder display the example in JavaScript while the `ts` display the example in TypeScript.

## Usage

### Execute

```bash
node index.js
```

But this example needs a fully configured FTP server to connect to.
